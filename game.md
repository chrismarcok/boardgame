# Game Rules

The game will be a ripoff of deception: murder in hong kong. Goal of the game is to find out how the murderer pulled off a murder, while receiving clues from the forensic scientist.

There are three rolls each player can have: Forensic Scientist, Investigator, or Murderer. There is 1 forensic scientist, 1 murderer, the rest are investigators.

## Game Start

Rolls are dealt out. The forensic scientist reveals himself. Everyone else is kept secret.

Each player EXCEPT the forensic scientist is dealt a fixed number (~4) WEAPON and CLUE cards. These cards are face up on the board for everyone to see.

The game starts and everyone closes their eyes. The forensic scientist and murderer open their eyes. The murder chooses a pair of ONE weapon and ONE clue card from the SAME person (not their own cards). Everyone closes their eyes and reopens them. 

## Forensic Scientist (FS)

The forensic scientist CANNOT speak, but has some cards of his own he can use to guide the investigators to guess the winning combination the murderer chose. The FS has ONE Cause of death card, FOUR location cards (of which he can only select one to play), and 4 randomly drawn clue cards. Each card will have 6~ options that the FS can choose from (can only choose one option per card). For example, if the murderer choose the murder weapon to be a book, the FS might choose the location card that has "bookstore" as an option, and highlight that option to the investigations. The FS must play the following 6 cards during the game:

A cause of death card just has 6 options for different causes of death. These likely will relate to the murder weapon.

A location card just has 6 different locations on them. These might relate to the murder weapon or the clue card the murderer chose.

A clue card has a random prompt on it that the FS must choose the best option for (6 options). For example, The title might be "Time of Day" and options: "Morning", "afternoon", "night", "evening", etc... Some clue cards might be totally irrelevant to the case, but the FS must highlight an option for each clue card.

## Murderer

The murderer chooses a combination of weapon and clue card while everyone has their eyes closed. The murderer loses if someone guesses their secretly chosen card combination. The murderer wins if nobody guesses correctly. The murderer is unknown to the investigators.

## Investigator

The investigator tries to deduce the murderer using info from the FS clues.

## Murderer and Investigator

At any point, a player can accuse another player and guess a combination of murder and clue cards to try to win the game. Since murderers are posing as investigators, they also get to do this. Each player can try one time.
